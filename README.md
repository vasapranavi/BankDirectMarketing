#Bank Direct Marketing

In this project, we will be using the pickle_dump_model to predict the probability of a customer subscribe to a bank direct marketing campaign.
Have analysed the data and created a model to predict the probability of a customer subscribing to a bank direct marketing campaign.

It is a binary classification problem. So I have used classification algorithms to solve the problem.

"bank_direct_marketing.ipynb" contain all my analysis and code.

Have created an API to the model. You can check by running postman as follows.
